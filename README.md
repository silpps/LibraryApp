# Sprint 3

## Deployment
- [Link to the final render page!](https://bookhive-fukw.onrender.com)
- [Second link to an older version!](https://libraryapp-5ifw.onrender.com)
- The final rendered page highlights the presented project and works as demonstrated during the presentation. However, a few of the route paths are not fully functional in this version due to time constraints during debugging. For a more complete navigation experience, the second link provides an earlier version where all paths are functional. That said, it's worth noting that the About/Help page is accessible and works correctly in the final version, while in the older version, navigation to this page is implemented but does not display the content (due to a few lines of code). The older version was just a deployment test.
